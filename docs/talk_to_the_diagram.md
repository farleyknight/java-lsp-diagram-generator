# Talk to the Diagram

This document outlines the features, design, and implementation considerations for allowing users to interact with a generated sequence diagram conversationally to modify or refine it.

## Overview

After an initial sequence diagram is generated based on a REST endpoint, the "Talk to the Diagram" feature enables users to ask follow-up questions or issue commands to the chatbot. These interactions will be interpreted by an LLM to modify the existing diagram (or its underlying data) and re-render it, allowing for iterative exploration and refinement.

Examples of user interactions:
*   "Remove the `LoggerService` from this diagram."
*   "What if the call to `PaymentService.processPayment()` fails? Show that path."
*   "Highlight all calls made by `OrderController`."
*   "Simplify the diagram to only show interactions between `UserService`, `OrderService`, and `DatabaseService`."
*   "Expand the details for the `AuthService.authenticate()` call."
