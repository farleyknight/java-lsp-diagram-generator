# Project Challenges

This document outlines some of the key technical challenges for this project.

## Sub-projects and Specific Challenges

*   **Java LSP Interaction**: Details on launching and communicating with the Java LSP server can be found in [Java LSP Implementation Details](./java_lsp.md).
    *   **Lifecycle Management:** Robustly managing the lifecycle of the Java LSP server process (startup, shutdown, crash recovery, resource consumption).
    *   **Performance of LSP Calls:** Some LSP calls (e.g., `textDocument/references` in large projects, or deep `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls` recursion) can be slow.
    *   **Filtering Out-of-Project Calls:** Accurately filtering out calls to JDK internals and external library dependencies to keep the call hierarchy focused on project-specific code. This relies on heuristics like path matching which might not be foolproof.
    *   **Accuracy of Call Hierarchy:** The accuracy and completeness of the call hierarchy provided by the LSP, which might be affected by project configuration, dynamic Java features (e.g., reflection), or aspects not fully captured by static analysis alone.
    *   **Compatibility:** Ensuring correct behavior and LSP feature support across different Java project structures, build systems (Maven, Gradle), and Java versions.

*   **LLM Interaction (Claude API)** ([Details](./llm_interaction.md)):
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Achieving consistent and accurate results from the LLM for both endpoint disambiguation and Mermaid diagram generation. This will likely require significant iterative refinement, especially for diverse Java coding styles or complex user queries.
    *   **Disambiguation Robustness:** Designing a reliable process for when the LLM provides low-confidence matches or multiple plausible endpoints. Handling this ambiguity effectively in the UI is crucial.
    *   **Mermaid Syntax Generation:** Ensuring the LLM consistently generates valid, well-structured, and semantically correct Mermaid syntax, particularly for complex call hierarchies involving conditional logic and multiple participants.
    *   **API Management:** Managing Claude API rate limits, costs, and potential latency, especially for large projects or numerous/complex analysis requests.
    *   **Context Window Limits:** Handling large inputs (e.g., extensive call hierarchies, a very large number of discovered endpoints) that might approach or exceed the LLM's context window limitations.

*   **`java-ast` Integration & Analysis** ([Details](./java_ast_integration.md)):
    *   **Tool Dependency & Stability:** Reliance on the `java-ast` tool's stability, ongoing maintenance, performance, and the consistency of its AST JSON output format across different Java versions or code constructs.
    *   **AST Complexity & Traversal:** Developing accurate and efficient algorithms for traversing complex Java ASTs to extract REST annotations and control flow information, especially considering diverse coding styles and advanced Java language features.
    *   **Performance:** The performance implications of invoking `java-ast` (as a separate Java process) frequently, particularly for initial project-wide endpoint discovery and subsequent per-method control flow analysis in large codebases.
    *   **Control Flow Mapping:** Correctly identifying and translating various Java control flow structures (e.g., complex loops, try-catch-finally blocks, switch statements) from the AST into meaningful and accurate conditions for the call hierarchy graph.

*   **Web UI & User Interaction (Express & Vue)** ([Details](./web_ui_interaction.md)):
    *   **Disambiguation User Experience:** Designing an intuitive and efficient UI for presenting disambiguation choices to the user when the LLM is uncertain about the target REST endpoint.
    *   **Responsiveness & Feedback:** Maintaining UI responsiveness and providing clear, non-blocking feedback to the user during potentially long-running backend operations (project analysis, LSP interaction, LLM calls).
    *   **Error Presentation:** Consistently handling and clearly presenting errors originating from various backend components (LSP, `java-ast`, LLM, network issues) to the user in a non-technical and actionable manner.
    *   **Project Path Validation:** Securely and effectively validating the user-provided Java project path on the backend, ensuring it's accessible and points to a valid project structure, especially concerning file system permissions and security.

*   **Mermaid Diagram Management & Rendering** ([Details](./mermaid_diagram_management.md)):
    *   **Rendering Complex Diagrams:** Ensuring `mermaid.js` can efficiently render and legibly display potentially large and complex sequence diagrams generated for intricate call hierarchies, without performance degradation or visual clutter in the browser.
    *   **Syntax Error Handling:** Robustly handling potentially malformed or subtly incorrect Mermaid syntax generated by the LLM, and providing useful feedback or fallbacks to the user instead of cryptic rendering failures.
    *   **(Future) Interactivity:** If advanced interactivity with the rendered Mermaid diagram (e.g., zoom, pan, clicking elements for more info) is desired in the future, this would add significant complexity beyond standard `mermaid.js` capabilities.

*   **Core Orchestration & Data Flow** ([Details](./core_orchestration.md)):
    *   **Workflow Complexity:** Managing the intricate multi-step orchestration logic, which involves sequential, conditional, and potentially iterative calls to various internal and external services.
    *   **Data Integrity & Transformation:** Ensuring seamless data transformation, consistency, and integrity as complex data structures (like the call hierarchy graph) are passed between and modified by different services.
    *   **Error Propagation & Aggregation:** Effectively aggregating, interpreting, and propagating errors from deep within the service call chain (e.g., an error during a specific LSP request or AST parsing) back to the user or the orchestrator for appropriate action and clear reporting.
    *   **State Management (Disambiguation):** If server-side caching or state management is used for the disambiguation step, implementing this robustly, including handling cache expiry, concurrency (if the application were to scale to multiple users), and data integrity.

## General Project Challenges

*   **Tooling Integration:** Integrating a Node.js/TypeScript application with Java-based tools (LSP, `java-ast`) introduces complexity in terms of inter-process communication (IPC), managing separate runtimes and environments, and ensuring smooth data exchange.
*   **End-to-End Accuracy:** The overall accuracy and relevance of the final generated sequence diagram is paramount and depends on the cumulative accuracy of each preceding step (discovery, disambiguation, call hierarchy construction, LLM interpretation). Errors or inaccuracies in any single step can compound and reduce the utility of the final output.
*   **Scalability for Large Java Projects:** Overall application performance and scalability when analyzing very large Java projects will be a concern, potentially impacting file parsing times, LSP communication responsiveness, AST traversal efficiency, LLM processing durations, and diagram rendering speeds.
*   **Configuration Management:** Effectively managing various configurations (e.g., paths to JDK, `java-ast.jar`, LSP server JARs, API keys) in a way that is easy for users to set up and maintain across different environments.
*   **Java Project Complexity:** Handling the diversity of real-world Java projects, including various build tools (Maven, Gradle), custom annotations, different versions of Java, and advanced language features (reflection, proxies, metaprogramming) that might challenge static analysis tools or require specific configurations.

*   **Talk to the Diagram Feature (NEW)** ([Details](./talk_to_the_diagram.md)):
    *   **LLM - Command Interpretation & Ambiguity:** Consistently and accurately interpreting diverse user commands (e.g., "remove X," "show path if Y fails," "focus on Z") to modify the diagram, given the inherent ambiguity of natural language.
    *   **LLM - Context Management:** Maintaining the context of the current diagram state and conversation history across multiple turns for iterative refinements.
    *   **Stateful Diagram Modification:** Developing robust methods to represent and apply user-requested modifications to the underlying diagram data (e.g., `CallHierarchyGraph`) without corrupting it, and deciding if these are visual filters or data model changes.
    *   **Mapping NL to Graph Operations:** Translating the LLM's interpretation of commands into concrete operations (filtering, highlighting, adding paths) on the graph data.
    *   **LLM - Preventing Unintended Modifications:** Handling LLM misinterpretations that lead to incorrect diagram changes; providing mechanisms for correction or recovery.
    *   **User Interface for Interaction:** Designing an intuitive UI that seamlessly integrates diagram display with a conversational input for modification commands.
    *   **Performance of Dynamic Updates:** Ensuring rapid re-rendering of the diagram after each modification for a fluid user experience, especially with complex diagrams.
    *   **Complexity of "What-If" Scenarios:** Implementing "what-if" scenarios might require the LLM to infer or simulate alternative paths/states, which is significantly complex.
    *   **Scope of Modifications:** Defining clear boundaries for what aspects of the diagram can be modified by user commands (e.g., filtering vs. adding hypothetical elements).
    *   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Implementing undo/redo for diagram modifications adds considerable state management complexity.
